##### Review Programming in C

* [In-class assignment](https://github.com/FarhanHyder/CSC332lab/tree/master/LAB1/CODES/inclass1_readingFromArg)

* [Write a program that displays "Hello, world!"](https://github.com/FarhanHyder/CSC332lab/tree/master/LAB1/CODES/1%20hello_world)

* [Write a program to print the numbers between 1 and 10, along with an indication of whether each is even or odd](https://github.com/FarhanHyder/CSC332lab/tree/master/LAB1/CODES/2%20odd_even_num_func)

* [Write a program to compute factorial of numbers between 1 and 10 using the given recursive function](https://github.com/FarhanHyder/CSC332lab/tree/master/LAB1/CODES/3%20factorial%20recursive)

* [Write a program that will prompt the user to input 10 integer values. The program will then identify and display the smallest, largest, most occurring number (with the count), and the average of 10 integers](https://github.com/FarhanHyder/CSC332lab/tree/master/LAB1/CODES/4%20array_sort_pointers)

*[Repeat the previous program with one modification. Instead of prompting the user to input integer values 10 times, read the values from an input text file, the name of which is specified as an argument]
